# DevOps Learning Hub

​​​​​​​The DevOps learning journey is a vast area apart from learning cloud, containerization, and configuration management. On the contrary, DevOps is about the culture of collaboration, co-creation, and community-led transformation of software delivery processes and tooling. Hence, it's essential to start this learning journey by understanding DevOps.  

The entire learning content is over 15 weeks. Most of it has been created using publicly available content, and no way it's an exhaustive list; hence community participation is required to make this even more useful resource.
